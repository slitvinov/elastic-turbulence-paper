\title{Two dimensional elastic turbulence}
\date{\today}


\begin{abstract}
In this paper, by smoothed dissipative particle dynamics(SDPD), we investigate the properties of polymer solution caused by intorducing polymer in solvent 
in two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow.\\
In polymer solution, we observe a disordered, turbulentlike mixing flow in
Kolmogorov flow at high Weissenbergnumber($Wi\approx29$) and small Reynolds numbers($Re\approx1$), at which the solvent flow is laminar.
We capture the vortex and energy spectrum with scaling law in this case,which proves that the instability of flow caused by polymers is formed in our simulation.

It is well known that the addition fo small amounts of long chain polymers can have a strong impact on flowing fluid's properties.
One of the most remarkable effects of highly viscous polymer solutions which has been
observed in experiments is the development of an elastic turbulence regime in the limit of small Reynolds number and strong 
elasticity \cite{groisman00}. The flow in this regime displays a rich dynamics, of the type usually encountered
in high Reynolds number turbulent flow in Newtonian fluids. Typical features of turbulent flows (e.g.,broad
range of active scales, growth of flow resistance) are observed in the experiments by Steinberg and collaborators \cite{groisman00},
even at low velocity and high viscosity, i.e. in the limit of vanishing Reynolds number. As a consequence of 
turbulent-like motion, elastic turbulence has been proposed as an efficient technique for mixing in very
low Reynolds flows, such as in microchannel flows \cite{groisman01}. Despite its great technological interest, elastic turbulence
is still only partially understood from a theoretical point of view. Presently available theoretical predictions are
based on simplified versions of viscoelastic models and on the analogy with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations \cite{balk01}\cite{fouxon03}. 
It has recently been successfully captured by direct numerical simulation based on Oldroyd-B model in a two-dimensional viscoelastic flow \cite{berti08}.
Note that in DNS simulation they use linear viscoelastic model(Oldroyd-B). In this paper we use FENE-P model,which is more accurate and accounts for the nonlinear character of polymer
elasticity,culminating in a finite molecular extensibility\cite{bird87}.\\
SDPD method is a particle model that is both thermodynamically consistent version of smoothed particle hydrodynamics(SPH) and a version of dissipative particle dynamics(DPD)
\cite{pep03}.The equations of SDPD in mesoscopic hydrodynamics are \cite{hu06}
%The pressure effect on the velocity
%\begin{equation}\label{equ:momeevo}
% \frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}^{(p)}}{dt}=-\frac{1}{m_i}\sum_j(\frac{p_i}{d_{i}^{2}}+\frac{p_j}{d_{j}^{2}})\frac{\partial W}{\partial r_{ij}}\mathbf{e}_{ij},
%\end{equation}
%where $\frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}^{(p)}}{dt}$ is the particle acceleration caused by pressure
%effects
%The viscosicty effect on the velocity is 
%\begin{equation}\label{equ:acceleration}
 %\frac{d\mathbf{v}{_i}{^{(\upsilon)}}}{dt}=-\frac{\eta}{m_i}\sum_j\left(\frac{p^i}{d_{i}^{2}}+\frac{p^j}{d_{j}^{2}}\right)\frac{\partial W}{\partial r_ij}(\mathbf{e}_{ij}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{ij}+\mathbf{v}_{ij}),
%\end{equation}
%the thermal fluctuation part is :
%\begin{equation}\label{equ:thermalb}
 %d\tilde{m}_i=0,
%d\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_i=\sum_j B_{ij}d\bar{\mathcal{W}}_{ij}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{ij}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{equ:thermalfur}
 % \dot{m}_i\vert_{irr}=0,
%\dot{\mathbf{P}}_i\vert_{irr}=-\sum_j\frac{B_{ij}}{4k_BT}
%(\mathbf{e}_{ij}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{ij}+\mathbf{v}_{ij}),
%\end{equation}
%in which $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the system temperature and 
%$B_{ij}=[-4k_BT\eta(\frac{1}{d_{i}^{2}}+\frac{1}{d_{j}^{2}})r_{ij}\frac{\partial W}{\partial r_{ij}}]^{1/2}.$
%so the equation can be written into:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{equ:momesum}
 \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt}=\mathbf{v}_i,\\
\frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt}=\frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}^{(p)}}{dt}+\frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}^{(\upsilon)}}{dt}+\frac{1}{m_i}d\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_i,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{r}_i,\mathbf{v}_i,m_i$ are position, velocity and mass of a particle $i$,respectively.
$\frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}^{(p)}}{dt},\frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}^{(\upsilon)}}{dt},\frac{1}{m_i}d\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_i $ are partilce acceleration caused by pressure,
viscous force and thermal fluctuation,respectively.
The solvent liquid is represented by SDPD partilces which represents physical elements of fluid containing potentially thousands of solvent(i.e.,water)
 molecules and interacting hydrodynamically.Concerning the polymer model,we consider it as a linear chain of polymer beads,each bead 
being represented as a mixture of real polymer monomers together with solvent molecules.The numberical realization of this physical model is obtained by selecting a number of
SDPD fluid particles and letting them interact,as well as hydrodynamically, also by addtional finitely extendable nonlinear elastic springs(FENE) 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:fene}
 \mathbf{F}^{FENE}(\mathbf{r}_{ij})=\frac{K\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{1-(r/R_0)^2}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the spring constant,$r=\sqrt{\mathbf{r}_{ij}\mathbf{r}_{ij}}$ is the bead-bead
distance, and $R_0$ represents the maximum extensibility of polymer molecules.\\
The periodic Kolmogorov flow is useful to study the elastic turbulence regime for visoelastic flows,withing force $\mathbf{F}=(F_0cos(k_yy),0)$,
where $k_y= 2\pi/L$ is the wave vector and $L$ is the length of the simulation box in the $y$-direction. A theoretical solution can be obtained for the 
velocity field which has the same functional form as the perturbation $\mathbf{v}=(v_0sin(k_yy),0)$
with $ v_0=F_0/\upsilon k_{y}^{2}$ and $\upsilon$ is the kinematic viscosity,which includes the solvent viscosicty and yero-shear contribution of polymers to the total solution viscosity. Nevertheless, for increasing values of the applied force $F_0$,
the Kolmogorov flow is known to be unstable and a secondary steady flow appears which consists of a periodic configuration of stationary vortices \cite{posch97}.
Indeed, a remarkable feature of the Kolmgorov flow is that even in the turbulent regime the mean velocity are accurately described by sinusoidal frofiles\cite{boffetta05}.
Here for this particular flow, the Reynolds number $Re=\frac{UL}{\upsilon}$ and the Weissenberg number $Wi=\frac{UL}{\tau}$, are defined in term of the amplitude U of the mean velocity,which is 
measured from the velocity profiles,$\tau$ is relaxation time of polymer.\\
In solvent only with thermal stochastic force the energy density is distributed equally in different scales,so the energy,the intergration of energy density in wavelength range
shouls be porpotional to wavenumber.Our simulation results fit this power-law perfectly.Note that in New-tonian flow the critical Renold number for instibility of Kolmogorov flow is $\sqrt{2}$ with respect to large-scale perturbations,i,e.,with wavelength much larger than L.
In our case the wavelength is equal to L,so the Renold number is larger than $6$ \cite{posch97}.We consider solvent at Re=1,in order to prove that the instability in polymer solution is 
only caused by presence of polymers. In solvent we set visocity $\mu = 2\times10^{-3}$, the number of particles is $36\times36$.theoretical physical phenomenon in solvent at vanishing Renold number.At Re=1.0
we get the enegy spectrum with an exponent $-0.7$,Fig.~\ref{fig:spesols}\\In the flow with weak viscosity at small Renold number,the depletion of the the energy is negligible 
with respect to the injected energy,so the  energy density keeps almost equal in different scales.Figure.\ref{fig:vorsols} shows one snapshot of the two-dimensional 
vorticiyt field in solvent at Re=1.the flow in this regime is not secondary flow and there is no big vortex structures.\\

\caption{Enegy spectrum in solvent at Re=1,the plateau at high $k$ may be due to the numberical noise in SDPD method and restricted spatial resolution of the method}
\end{figure} 
In Polymer solution we investigate the flow at Re=1 and Wi=29, in which the relaxation time of polymer $\tau$ is 
calculated from the fitting of autocorrelation function of end to end distance vector of polymer in a thermal stochastic simulaiton.
We observe some irregular vortexes  as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:vorpols}. Note that the vortex structure is not continous as in DNS with linear model \cite{berti08}.
This may be resulted from nonlinear model and the thermal fluctuations.
Fig.\ref{fig:spepols} show the power of velocity fluctuations over wavelength.The spectrum exhibits power lay decay with exponent $-1.1$.
